### General Description
A mobile app that allows Physical Education teachers to track their student's performance and calculate their respective scores
automatically.

Currently PE teachers record their student's performance using pen and paper, they then input
this data to the computer, and lastly use various software products (usually Microsoft Excel) to calculate
their student's scores.
This process is grossly inefficient.
This app empowers the user to: 
- Track student's performance digitally, substituting pen and paper.
- Calculate a student's score for each physical exam.
- Export student's performance and scores to an excel file.
- Send studentâ€™s performance and scores to the respective student, via an SMS or Whatsapp message.
