### General Description
Made for gymnastic teachers for tracking students physical exams and calculating their results in each specific exam.

Instead of writing the students results to a peace of paper and from there the teacher needs to type it to an excel file,
this app calculates the student grade and by pressing "send to mail" the teacher gets in his email box an excel file filled with all the data. 

In addition the teacher can make a premade excel file with all the names and classes of his students that the app can read
and populate the results screen, and from there all he needs to do is just update the student results when the latters finished the exams. with this action he can save time typing students names and classes.
