# Fitracker

### General Description
Made for gymnastic teachers for tracking students physical exams and calculating their results in each specific exam.

Instead of writing the students results to a peace of paper and from there the teacher needs to type it to an excel file,
for it to calculate the student grade, this app calculates the student grade. 
The app provides the following features:

- Calculates the student grade for each specific exam.
- Exports the students scores & grades to an excel file to be sent via an email to the teacher.
- Option to send the student scores & grades via an SMS/Whatsapp.
